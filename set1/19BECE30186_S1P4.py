# Set-1 Practical-4 : Write a Python program to find square root of positive number.

A = float(input("Enter the value that you want to find Square root : "))
sqrt = A ** 0.5
print("The value of Square root is :", sqrt)

# Using sqrt() function:
# import math
# A = float(input("Enter the value that you want to find Square root : "))
# sqrt = math.sqrt(A)
# print ("The value of Square root is :", sqrt)
